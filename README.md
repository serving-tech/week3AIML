## 🧪 Project Structure

| Task | Description | Tool | Notebook |
|------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Task 1** | Decision Tree Classification of Iris Flowers | `Scikit-learn` | [`iris_classification.ipynb`](./task1.py) |
| **Task 2** | CNN for MNIST Digit Recognition | `TensorFlow` | [`mnist_cnn_tensorflow.ipynb`](./task2.py) |
| **Task 3** | Named Entity Recognition + Sentiment | `spaCy` | [`amazon_reviews_ner_sentiment.ipynb`](./task3.py) |

## 🔐 Ethical Reflection

We reflected on biases in sentiment and digit recognition models and discussed mitigation tools such as:
- TensorFlow Fairness Indicators
- Custom rule-based logic in spaCy

## 🛠️ Running the Notebooks

1. Open each `.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab** or Jupyter.
2. Ensure you have installed dependencies like `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `spacy`.
3. Run cells sequentially.

To install requirements locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
